This is a flower database project that I wrote for cs325 (Software Engineering) at SIUE.<br />
<br />
The goal of the project was to creating a GUI and working database model for a 'Researcher'
to store flowers.<br />
<br />
They needed to be able to add flowers, edit flowers, delete flowers, and search for flowers
by name, family, and photo (There needed to be a working photo search algorithm).<br />
<br />
The project itself isn't fully finished but there's a basic prototype and working GUI/Database.
All basic functionality also functions correctly and met requirements.<br />
<br />
I was personally responsible for the folowing classes:<br />
addUser.cs (and GUIs & Controllers)<br />
batchAddUser.cs (and GUIs &  Controllers)<br />
deleteUser.cs (GUIs & Controllers)<br />
editUsers.cs (GUIs & Controllers)<br />
login.cs (GUIs & Controllers)<br />
userController.cs<br />
Much of the database manager (DatabaseManager.cs)<br />
The design of the data structure (flower_database.mdf)<br />
Various other fixes, and design choices.<br />
A function to pull data from a .xlsx file (addBatchUsers)<br />
Salting and Hashing for the database (SaltedHashbrowns.cs)<br />
