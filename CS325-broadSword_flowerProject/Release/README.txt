Read me:

The database has no default flowers in it. You will have to atleast adda couple offlowers before testing all the functionality.

The database has users init. One to log in with is with the username: “jared”and password: “pass”.

When searching for flowers you can choose between three options to search for by text.
If you want to search by picture all of you have to do is pick a picture by dragging or manually uploading a picture and it will conduct the search automatically.

The view Histogram is using a stub and isn’t integrated with the database.

To access a full userlist open either the Edit user or delete user dialog. Within those two GUI’s you can do the functionality of editingor deleting a user.
